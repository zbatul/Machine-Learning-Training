 
 I have uploaded the following :  
 
 1. Jupyter notebook for implementation of perceptron, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent to check if the data can be linearly classified or not.
 2. The 4 datsets in .csv format.
 3. The gif animation showing the convergence of the data for classification.

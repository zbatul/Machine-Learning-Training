I have uploaded 2 ipython notebooks.

First notebook contains the Numpy Exercise Questions.

Second notebook contains the solution to the exercise.  
  Part A: Make use of the following inbuilt api's.  
  Part B: For the all api's mentioned above implement your own version of it exxcept linalg.solve.    
          At minimum each implementation of yours should support 2d matrices.

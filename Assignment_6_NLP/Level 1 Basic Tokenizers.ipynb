He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28][29][30][31] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry,[32][33] and his maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota.[34] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.[32]\n",

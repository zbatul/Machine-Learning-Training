    "## Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunk extraction is a useful preliminary step to information extraction, that creates parse trees from unstructured text with a chunker. Once you have a parse tree of a sentence, you can do more specific information extraction, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the chunk structure for a given sentence, the RegexpParser chunker begins with a flat structure in which no tokens are chunked. The chunking rules are applied in turn, successively updating the chunk structure. Once all of the rules have been invoked, the resulting chunk structure is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentence tokenization of the text.\n",
    "2. Word tokenization.\n",
    "3. POS tagging.\n",
    "4. Run the chunk rule. \n"

He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28][29][30][31] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry,[32][33] and his maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota.[34] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.[32]\n",

I have uploaded one python script.  

It contains implementation of the False Position method in Python.  
  
The false position method or regula falsi method is a term for problem-solving
methods in arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. In simple terms, these methods
begin by attempting to evaluate a problem using test (“false”) values for the
variables, and then adjust the values accordingly.  

The Algorithm  
  
Inputs to your Algorithm:  
1. f(x) - The given function  
2. x0, x1 - The two initial approximations. Such that f(x0) * f(x1) < 0.  
3. ξ - The Tolerance  
4. N - The maximum number of Iterations  

Output:  
An approximation to the Root.  
  
Assignment:
1. Implement the False Position Method in Python.    
2. Find the roots of the following equations:    
i. x^2 − 2x − 1 = 0 with Interval [1,2] and Tolerance 0.0001    
ii. 5sin(x)^2 − 8cos(x)^5 = 0 with Interval [0.5,1.5] and Tolerance 0.000001
